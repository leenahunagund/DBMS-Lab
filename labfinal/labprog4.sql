/*4. Consider the database schemas given below.
Write ER diagram and schema diagram. The primary keys are underlined and the data types are specified.
Create tables for the following schema listed below by properly specifying the primary keys and foreign keys.
Enter at least five tuples for each relation.
Student enrollment in courses and books adopted for each course
STUDENT (regno: string, name: string, major: string, bdate: date)
COURSE (course#:int, cname: string, dept: string)
ENROLL(regno:string, course#: int,sem: int,marks: int)
BOOK-ADOPTION (course#:int, sem: int, book-ISBN: int)
TEXT (book-ISBN: int, book-title: string, publisher: string,author: string)
1.	Demonstrate how you add a new text book to the database and make this book be adopted by some department.  
2.	Produce a list of text books (include Course #, Book-ISBN, Book-title) in the alphabetical order for courses offered by the ‘CS’ department that use more than two books.  
3.	List any department that has all its adopted books published by a specific publisher. 
4.	List the students who have scored maximum marks in ‘DBMS’ course. 
5.	Create a view to display all the courses opted by a student along with marks obtained.
6.	Create a trigger that prevents a student from enrolling in a course if the marks prerequisite is less than  40.
